# Product Perspective

Our mobile app named "Intelli Notes", developed for Null Studios, incorporates AI and traditional note-taking into a single platform and is a standalone, self-contained system designed to help the way users capture, enhance, and organize their ideas and hence, notes.
Most people (for example: students, creative writers and even office workers) when using a standard notes app need to constantly refer to other sources like Chat GPT, Grammarly, Google etc. often making the process very time consuming. Hence, to overcome this time-consuming hurdle, our mobile app, positioned as a unique solution in the market, leverages Flutter, Dart, and the GPT-3.5 API to integrate advanced AI capabilities seamlessly into the note-taking process. The app will allow the user to enhance its text by incorporating features such as title generation, synonym suggestions, paraphrasing, word count etc. Additionally, it will prioritize user security by providing the option to lock notes, ensuring sensitive information remains private.

The mobile appâ€™s role, tailored for those in academic or creative fields, will vary according to the user, from a note-taking assistant to a creative idea provider. In conclusion, our app aims to transform your note-taking experience, empowering you to focus on your ideas without the hassle of constant external references. It will provide a personal user-friendly space for those seeking to make their note taking process easier than ever.

Below is an overview of how the app will function and its features:

## 9. Save Note File

The `notesave.dart` file provides functionalities for managing notes within the application. It includes methods for saving new notes and updating existing ones in a Firestore database.

### Features

- Save new notes with title, content, creation date, and color ID.
- Will save new note if either title or content is written.
- Update existing notes with new title and content.

### Dependencies

Ensure that the following dependencies are imported into your Flutter project:

- `flutter/material.dart`: Flutter framework for building UI.
- `cloud_firestore.dart`: Firestore package for accessing Firestore database.

### State Management

This code ensures that new notes are saved only if either the title or the body is not empty. This is achieved by checking if either the title or body is not empty before saving the note to the Firestore database.

### Implementation

**Save Note Function (`saveNote()`)**

The `saveNoteIfNotEmpty` function is responsible for saving a new note to the Firestore database. It takes parameters for the note's title, body, creation date, and color ID. Before saving the note, it checks if either the title or the body is not empty. If either is not empty, the note is saved to the Firestore database. Otherwise, it does not save the note.

**Update Note Function (`updateNote`)**

The `updateNote` function is used to update an existing note in the Firestore database. It requires the document ID of the note to be updated, along with the new title and content. Upon invocation, it updates the specified note with the provided title and content.

**Conditional Check for Saving Note**

The conditional check `if (title.isNotEmpty || body.isNotEmpty)` ensures that a new note is saved only if either the title or the body is not empty. This prevents saving empty notes into the database.

**Error Handling**

Error handling is implemented using `then()` and `catchError()` methods. If an error occurs during the saving or updating process, it is caught and an error message is printed to the console. This helps in identifying and troubleshooting any issues that may arise during note management operations.

## 10. Note Delete File
The `notedelete.dart` file contains utility functions for confirming and executing the deletion of notes. These functions are primarily used in conjunction with the `AlertDialog` widget to prompt the user for confirmation before deleting a note.

2. **Move Note to DeletedNotes Collection**: Moves the selected note from the "Notes" collection to the "DeletedNotes" collection in Firestore before deleting it.
3. **Delete Note Card**: Deletes the note from the "Notes" collection after it has been successfully moved to the "DeletedNotes" collection.

### Implementation Details:
- **confirmDelete**: Creates an AlertDialog with options to cancel or delete the note.
- **moveNoteToDeleted**: Retrieves the note from Firestore, moves it to the "DeletedNotes" collection, and then calls `deleteNoteCard`.
- **deleteNoteCard**: Deletes the note from the "Notes" collection and closes the AlertDialog and the current screen.
